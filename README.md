This repository contains code that I created to import data from json documents into either a mongodb or a sql db. The code is wirtten to handle specific formatted data form a specificied filepath data and is will not adapt to other formats or filepaths unless it is updated. 

You see two files here one for MongoDB import and one for SQL import. Inside each you will find a java maven project for the import pocesses. They have their properties files that will guide you through the setup phase.
